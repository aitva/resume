#Resume

This repository contains my resume. I have written it in Markdown
and I use CSS for formatting.

##Display The Resume

I work on my resume using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com).
To display the resume you will need to install Caddy and 
execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aitva/resume.git
cd resume
caddy
```

A website will be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080).
