# resume
Resume contains my resume in markdown format.

## Building
Any "markdown-to-html" tool should do. As a reference
I am using :

- [Blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool)
- [markdownfmt](https://github.com/shurcooL/markdownfmt)
- Vim...

Just build the project, open the html in a browser and print it as PDF.
Enjoy !
